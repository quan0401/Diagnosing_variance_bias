# Diagnosing_variance_bias
To fix a high bias problem, you can:

- try adding polynomial features
- try getting additional features
- try decreasing the regularization parameter

To fix a high variance problem, you can:

- try increasing the regularization parameter
- try smaller sets of features
- get more training examples

In this repo will illustrate how to address bias and variance problem in examples.
